instructions:

Focus on Rules which are in L2 and L1 level only

Each member is responsible for 5 rules and 4 recommendations. If possible, the members must explain and demo the rule using an example

As much as possible, write example programs that will demonstrate 2 or more rules together.

NOTE: Please ignore Rule 50 and Rule 49

When writing sample code, ensure you use JavaDoc style comments.
